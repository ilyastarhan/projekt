    /*task02

    Write a method doubleList that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter
     and that replaces every string with two of that string. For example, if the
     list stores the values {"how", "are", "you?"} before the method is called,
      it should store the values {"how", "how", "are", "are", "you?", "you?"}
      after the method finishes executing.

        for(int i = 0; i<list.size(); i+=2){
        list.add(i+1, list.get(i));
            }
            System.out.println(list);
     */
